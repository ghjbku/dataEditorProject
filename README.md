# dataEditorProject

project to help with modifying save data in Xiuzhen idle (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649730/xiuzhen_idle/)

runnable jar file can be found in the **target** folder, or you can compile it yourself if you feel like it :)
you will need to open the **"run editor.bat"** file (or use the command: **java -jar saveDataEditor-versionNumber-SNAPSHOT.jar**)

current progress (V 1.0.3):
- Editing player inventory slots (adding new one is not possible yet, only by editing an existing item's id)
